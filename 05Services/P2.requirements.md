- ASP.NET Core REST service
    - follow standard HTTP uniform interface, except hypermedia
    - architecture with separation of concerns between domain/business logic, data access, and API; repository pattern
    - deployed to Azure App Service
    - Entity Framework Core
        - DB should be on the cloud
        - all DB/network access should be async
    - server-side validation
    - support filtering
    - logging
    - implement an API Description Language, e.g. using Swashbuckle
    - (optional: implement a custom filter, health check, or middleware, e.g. exception-handling middleware)
- Azure Pipelines
    - build definitions
        - Unit tests
        - SonarCloud
    - (optional: release definitions with deploy instead of in build, and with health checks)
- must have some calls to an external API, or integration with some other service
- (optional: authentication and authorization with Azure AD/[Open ID Connect](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/tree/master/4-WebApp-your-API ))
- Project board to track user stories across team
